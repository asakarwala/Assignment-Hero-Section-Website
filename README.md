# Interactive Hero Section

This project recreates a dynamic hero section inspired by the Pha5e design. It features smooth animations, hover interactions, and a subtle mouse movement effect that gives the impression of the images following the user's cursor.

## Features

- **Initial Animation:**  
  Text and images fade in smoothly on page load.

- **Hover Interaction:**  
  - The hovered image displays in full color while the others show a vector-like (grayscale) effect.
  - The hero text color changes to engage the viewer.

- **Mouse Movement Effect:**  
  The hovered image slightly moves in response to the mouse position within its container.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS:** Styling, animations, and hover effects.
- **JavaScript:** Dynamic interactions, including mouse movement tracking.
- **Bootstrap:** Responsive grid layout (optional but used for convenience).
